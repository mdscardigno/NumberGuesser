# NumberGuesser

<!-- Your program should be able to handle a person thinking of a number between 1 and 1024.
Your program should assume the human player would answer any guess truthfully.

Problem

Once the program starts, you should display a greeting to the user describing the challenge.
Prompt the user with your guess and allow them to tell you if their number is higher, lower, or correct.
Keep refining your guess until you have the correct answer.
